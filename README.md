## App Brainstorming
### Favorite Apps
1. Duolingo
- Animation at the start of the app
- Descriptive icons and colors within the app
2. Credit Karma
- Intutive user interface and navigation
- Simple and clean design
 3. Transit
 - Real time information of public bus and train routes
 - Crowd sourced information on the safety and cleanness of public transport
 - Notification to users when a bus or train arrives to their desired destination

### New app idea
I would like to build a simple app that allows users to track their daily habits. Users could log in to their account and mark off any habits they have completed throughout the day. The app could then display a graph showing the user's progress over time.

## Notes
Navigating the XCode IDE and getting used to its various features was something I had to learn.
